# Palette Picker

This was a two week paired project at Turing School of Software & Design, where we built our own backend using Express.js, Knex, and PostgreSQL. The backend allows a user to create project folders and then create palettes to add to individual projects. The user can generate a random color palette to add, or lock specific colors and build their own palette. The user can delete projects and palettes from the database.
